Suppliers	suppliers, deliveries	Suppliers provide lumber and other materials.
Workforce	workers, job_assignments	Workers perform cutting jobs.
System Logging (optional)	audit_logs, users	Tracks actions (admin/staff users).

🧠 NORMALIZATION SUMMARY (3NF)
Normal Form	How it’s satisfied
1NF	All tables have atomic values, no repeating groups (✓)
2NF	No partial dependency — each non-key depends on full PK (✓)
3NF	No transitive dependencies — e.g., supplier contact info stays in suppliers, not in deliveries (✓)
